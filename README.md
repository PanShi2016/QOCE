# SSCE
These codes are for our paper "Spectral Subspace based Clique Expansion for Global Community Detection"
## Requirements
Before compiling codes, the following software should be installed in your system.
- Matlab
- gcc (for Linux and Mac) or Microsoft Visual Studio (for Windows)
## Datasets Information
- LFR benchmark graphs (available at http://sites.google.com/site/santofortunato/inthepress2/)
- Amazon dataset (available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/)
- Citeseer and Cora refer to (1), Senate refers to (2), and HS as well as SC refer to (3)

### Example dataset
- Citeseer dataset
- nodes: 2110, edges: 3668
- Seven communities with ground truth size >= 10
## How to run SSCE algorithm
1. Find all maximal cliques
```
$ cd GetMaxCliques
$ Set the minimum size of clique "minimumCliqueSize" in code called "find_cliques.cpp"
$ cd build
$ sh makefile
$ sh produceMaximumCliques
```
2. Detect communities from maximum cliques
```
$ cd LLSA_codes 
$ matlab 
$ mex -largeArrayDims GetLocalCond.c   % compile the mex file 
$ mex -largeArrayDims hkgrow_mex.cpp   % compile the mex file 
$ LLSA(k,alpha) 
```
### Command Options:

k: number of Lanczos iteration (default: 4)

alpha: a parameter controls local minimal conductance (default: 1.03)
