### Example dataset
- Karate dataset
- nodes: 34, edges: 78
- two communities with ground truth size >= 3

## How to run QOCE algorithm
1. Find all maximal cliques
```
$ cd GetMaxCliques
$ Set the minimum size of clique "minimumCliqueSize" in code called "find_cliques.cpp"
$ cd build
$ sh makefile
$ sh produceMaximumCliques
```
2. Detect communities from maximum cliques
```
$ cd QOCE_codes 
$ matlab 
$ mex -largeArrayDims rwvec_mex.cpp   % compile the mex file 
$ QOCE(k0,alpha) 
```
Command Options:

minimumCliqueSize: minimum size of clique (default: 3)

k0: steps of random walk for sampling (default: 3)

alpha: a parameter controls quadratic optimization (default: 0.2)

## How to run baseline algorithms
```
$ cd baseline_codes
$ sh complile-all.sh
$ sh run.sh
$ cd processCode
$ matlab
$ getResults
```
